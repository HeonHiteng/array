# 2D Array
Grade multiple-choice test

The problem is to write a program that grades multiple-choice tests. Suppose there are eight students and ten questions, and the answers are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records a student’s answers to the questions, as shown in the following array.

The key is stored in a one-dimensional array:

Key to the Questions: 

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

D  B  D  C  C  D  A  E  A  D

Your program grades the test and displays the result. It compares each student’s answers with
the key, counts the number of correct answers, and displays it.
